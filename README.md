# eCrypt
OS encryption patch

enCrypt 1.0 is a patch for the Minix Operating System (OS) that encrypts files before they are saved to the file system and decrypts them when they are opened. 
It is applied to efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel without changing its existing source code.
